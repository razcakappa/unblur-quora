Un-censor*, Un-blur* images on Quora

Almost every image is censored using Quora's new image censorship algorithm. Not only is the image NSFW, but it is also an innocent image for which a human cannot discover an adequate justification. This plugin would just overwrite styles in order to unblur* the photos.  

*WARNING: This will unblur NSFQ aswell
